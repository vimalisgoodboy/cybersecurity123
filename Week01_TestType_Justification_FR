# Test Type Justification – FinCart (Week-01)







Testing Approach: Gray-Box Penetration Testing



Orientation: Goal-Oriented Testing



Delivery Model: Conventional Penetration Testing

## Mapping Decisions to Course Concepts





**Gray-Box vs Black-Box and White-Box Testing:**



Gray-box testing offers a practical middle ground. Limited system knowledge helps reduce time spent on basic discovery while still allowing the tester to think and act like a real attacker. This makes testing efficient, realistic, and cost-effective.



**Goal-Oriented Testing:**



The testing is aligned with real business risks. Instead of checking every possible vulnerability, efforts are focused on high-impact scenarios such as account takeover and unauthorized fund transfers that could directly affect users and the organization.



**Conventional Penetration Testing Model:**



Provides an optimal balance between cost and comprehensiveness by ensuring a well-defined scope and rules of engagement, which allows controlled execution of testing activities and results in a substantial reduction in operational and business risk.





## Cost vs ROI



Gray-box testing provides a better return on investment by focusing on significant risks. It also lowers effort and cost when compared to complete white-box testing.





## Risk Awareness



Testing follows safe principles identified in Week 01. All types of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks are excluded. Testing takes place during approved non-business hours to prevent service issues or customer impact. Rules of engagement and operational limits help ensure that security vulnerabilities are found without increasing business risk.
