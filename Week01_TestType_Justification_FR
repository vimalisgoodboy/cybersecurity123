# Test Type Justification – FinCart (Week 01)

## Testing Overview

**Testing Approach:** Gray-Box Penetration Testing  
**Orientation:** Goal-Oriented Testing  
**Delivery Model:** Conventional Penetration Testing  

## Mapping Decisions to Course Concepts

### Gray-Box vs Black-Box and White-Box Testing
- Achieves a practical balance between cost and completeness  
- Reduces discovery time  
- Maintains a realistic attacker’s perspective with limited internal knowledge  

### Goal-Oriented Testing
- Focuses on business goals  
- Targets attack scenarios that lead to account takeovers  
- Targets unauthorized money transfers  
- Prioritizes impact over general vulnerability testing  

### Conventional Penetration Testing Model
- Ensures a clear scope  
- Sets specific rules of engagement  
- Allows controlled execution of testing activities  
- Reduces operational and business risk  

## Cost vs ROI
- Gray-box testing offers a higher return on investment  
- Focuses on high-impact risks  
- Lowers effort and cost compared to full white-box testing  

## Risk Awareness
- Testing follows safe principles outlined in Week 01  
- Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks are not included  
- Testing occurs only during approved non-business hours  
- Prevents service degradation and customer impact  
- Rules of engagement and operational limits ensure vulnerability discovery without adding business risk
